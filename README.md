# Hey, I'm Kayra.

By trade I'm a full stack engineer who cares about everything from design to dev-ops, but most of all **I care about the value being delivered to the user.** I'm a [product engineer](https://curiousest.com/product-engineer/). 

I'm currently looking for my next role in 🇯🇵 Tokyo. In my last position I was a Solution Architect at Tractable: an [AI company](https://tractable.ai).

I lead a [group of engineers](https://github.com/dinkers) from different disciplines who [share knowledge](http://dinkers.io), provide feedback on personal projects, and work on apps together.

I run a company called Tigin that is a vehicle for me to bring ideas to market. I am currently building my first commercial product. 

Feel free to:
